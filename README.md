_FinCore Budget Management System_

In this project my objectives include:
- Creating a fully functional console-based budget management system
- Using complex data structures such as Linked Lists to enable efficiency within this project
- Ensuring the application is user friendly and easy to understand

_Development Enviroment_

IDE

Within FinCore, I have decided to use **Visual Studio Code** as my IDE. This is because it is very user-friendly and is an application which I am already familiar with, meaning I can maximise efficiency when developing the project. It also means that I do not have to learn any new keyboard shortcuts while in development, allowing me to work more on my code and less on learning shortcuts.

JDK

I have also chose to use **OpenJDK** as my **Java Development Kit,** with Java 21 installed. This is mainly due to its lack of licensing due to it being open sourced, which makes it a very cost-effective solution compared to other options such as **Oracle**. 

_Project Structure_

For FinCore's project structure, I have chosen to use a standard build tool, instead of using _Maven_ or _Gradle_. This is because I experienced issues using these build tools in project setup. Here is the file structure that I have at the beginning of my project
